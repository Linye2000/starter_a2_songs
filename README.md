# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Song List 2.0 by Jiaxiang Lin

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of songs to learn.

# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

   > This project took me two weeks. It was time-consuming due to the complexities of GUI design with Kivy and handling class-based data management.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

   > I'm really pleased with how I implemented the GUI using the Kivy framework. The way I managed the song data using classes also turned out to be quite effective.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

   > I wish I had refined the user interface more. Also, adding more features like advanced song sorting or filtering could have made the project better.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

   > The modular design approach worked well, with different classes for different functionalities. Also, using JSON for data storage proved to be simple and effective.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

   > Next time, I'll focus more on comprehensive testing and enhancing the user interface. Implementing additional functionalities like song editing could also be beneficial.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

   > I relied heavily on the Kivy documentation for GUI development and Python's official documentation. Online tutorials and forums were also helpful for specific issues and advanced features.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

   > The main challenges were mastering Kivy for GUI development and ensuring robust data handling. I overcame these through practice, consulting documentation, and community forums.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.

   > Using classes greatly improved the organization and maintainability of my code. They helped in encapsulating data and behaviors, making the code modular and easier to understand.
